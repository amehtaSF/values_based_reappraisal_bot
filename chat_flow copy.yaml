      Look at the description of the issue the user described.
      In any issue, there are often several separable facets that cause the negative emotion to arise. 
      I want you to as concisely as possible, 
      summarize what are the facets that give rise to the negative emotion.
      Rephrase the sentences to be in different words than the user provided.
      Each facet read on its own should indicate something negative.
      At the end, propose a few potential emotions the user might feel and 
      ask them if they feel those emotions/
      
      Format the output as a bulleted list with phrases written in the second person and 
      verify that each bullet point is something negative, 
      when read on its own without the other list items. 
      Make the list as short as possible without missing anything.
      Do not invent any information the user did not provide.
      Do not try to guess any external circumstances unless they have been explicitly stated.
      Only include the bulleted list and the question about the emotions.
      Verify each bullet point is negative before sending.

      <issue>
      Seeing my aunt and grandmother both suffering from Frontal Lobe Dementia. 
      It is something that has been disheartening to watch and very frequent on my mind. 
      I hate seeing someone I know and love go through this and 
      hate that I am one to lose patience with them when they forget who I am and 
      other family members or have a normal conversation then 
      ten minutes later not even remember what we could have talked about. 
      It's like someone is missing but they still are standing right in front of you. 
      It is also hard when they need help to do things and 
      I am not always in the bes shape to help out like giving them showers and 
      baths because you have to have a lot of strength to do it sometimes and 
      there are many days where I am just not up to par.

      <issue>
      Lately I have been feeling down and potentially depressed 
      about not having enough money to do the things I want and 
      not being able to pay bills on time. 
      I recently had to resort to paying bills using my credit card and 
      recently have been behind on those. 
      I am able to just pay the monthly fees only. 
      Which I already knew was a bad thing to start doing. 
      Now it is the fact I rely on credit card to pay for everything because 
      my whole paycheck goes to my credit card payback but 
      still haven't caught up yet and 
      I am in the second month of doing this 
      I feel as though things are really piling up and 
      don't know what I am going to do to dig myself 
      out of the hole I feel that I am currently digging.

      Read about the issue the user is facing and generate questions to ask the person
      that will help surmise what are their values in the domain in which the issue lies. 
      Think about what is the domain in which there issue lies first 
      and then generate questions to get at their values in that domain.
      Generate questions that are relatively broad and not just about the issue itself.
      Values refer to what is important to them in that domain. 
      By domain, we mean things like "work", "family", "finance", "health", etc.
      What do they care about in that domain?
      Come up with 3 to 5 questions. 
      The questions should not be about the context of the issue.

      Read this issue that someone is facing and the description of their values, 
      and I want you to generate a cognitive reappraisal for them.
      Do not try to solve the problem and do not tell the person what to do.
      Just help them see it in a way that will help them feel better, given their values.
      Do not talk about their values explicitly, just consider them when you generate your response. 
      Write 3 sentences.
      Every sentence should be responsive to their values without explicitly mentioning 
      that it is their values.
