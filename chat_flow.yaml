    Look at the description of the issue the user described.
    In any issue, there are often several separable facets that cause the negative emotion to arise. 
    I want you to as concisely as possible, 
    summarize what are the facets that give rise to the negative emotion. 
    Each facet read on its own should indicate something negative.
    
    Format the output as a numbered list with phrases written in the second person and 
    verify that each bullet point is something negative, 
    when read on its own without the other list items. 
    Make the list as short as possible without missing anything.
