      Seeing my aunt and grandmother both suffering from Frontal Lobe Dementia. 
      It is something that has been disheartening to watch and very frequent on my mind. 
      I hate seeing someone I know and love go through this and 
      hate that I am one to lose patience with them when they forget who I am and 
      other family members or have a normal conversation then 
      ten minutes later not even remember what we could have talked about. 
      It's like someone is missing but they still are standing right in front of you. 
      It is also hard when they need help to do things and 
      I am not always in the bes shape to help out like giving them showers and 
      baths because you have to have a lot of strength to do it sometimes and 
      there are many days where I am just not up to par.

      Lately I have been feeling down and potentially depressed 
      about not having enough money to do the things I want and 
      not being able to pay bills on time. 
      I recently had to resort to paying bills using my credit card and 
      recently have been behind on those. 
      I am able to just pay the monthly fees only. 
      Which I already knew was a bad thing to start doing. 
      Now it is the fact I rely on credit card to pay for everything because 
      my whole paycheck goes to my credit card payback but 
      still haven't caught up yet and 
      I am in the second month of doing this 
      I feel as though things are really piling up and 
      don't know what I am going to do to dig myself 
      out of the hole I feel that I am currently digging.

      It involves making decisions and taking actions based on one's own judgment and preferences, rather than relying on others.
      Do not try to solve the problem and do not tell the person what to do.
      Just help them see it in a way that will help them feel better 
      given their value of independence.
      Write 3 sentences.

    gpt_security: >
      Read this issue that someone is facing
      and generate a cognitive reappraisal that would be helpful for someone
      who really values security.
      Valuing security means prioritizing safety, stability, and protection from harm or danger. 
      It involves seeking out environments, relationships, and situations that provide a sense of predictability and well-being.
      Do not try to solve the problem and do not tell the person what to do.
      Just help them see it in a way that will help them feel better 
      given their value of security.
      Write 3 sentences.



    gpt_strength_weakness: >
      Read the issue  and the cognitive reappraisal. 
      This cognitive reappraisal is intended to relate to the value of "{value}". 
      {description}
      
      Sometimes the reappraisal for an issue fits really well with a particular value. 
      The reappraisal really speaks to a person with that value and 
      is likely to be very effective for someone with that value. 
      Other times, a reappraisal can be written to relate to a value, 
      but it's like a square peg in a round hole. 
      Perhaps because the value itself is not really related to what is causing a problem for the individual. 
      Please identify the strengths of this reappraisal as an effective reappraisal 
      that targets the value of "{value}" and the areas where it could be improved.

    gpt_new_reap: >
      Improve the cognitive reappraisal in light of the strengths and areas for improvement.
      Limit your reappraisal to no more than 3 sentences. Provide only the reappraisal text with no quotes or other text.

      The user is going to tell you about an emotional issue they are having. 
      You need to ask questions to get a better understanding of what's going on and how the person feels. 

      Some things that are good to know are:

      - why different people in the story are behaving the way they are
      - what the user thinks the outcome of the situation might be
      - how the user feels about different aspects of the story
      - relevant history or events leading up to the situation
      - who are the key people involved
      - how is the issue affecting them in various ways, both concretely and emotionally
      - what are obstacles preventing resolution
      - what would be a desired outcome of the situation

      Some of these details may already be included. Some may be relevant and some may not be relevant. 
      Ask the user to clarify different aspects. Only ask one question per message.
