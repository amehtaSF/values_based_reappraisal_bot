      <issue>
      My adult daughter has been having a problem with alcohol.
      She has been drinking almost everyday and sometimes to the point of passing out.
      I have talked to her about it and she wants to be sober, 
      so I'm having her track how many days she does not drink and 
      I have provided her with a list of AA meetings in her area.  
      I will continue to follow with her on her progress.</issue>

      <issue>
      Seeing my aunt and grandmother both suffering from Frontal Lobe Dementia. 
      It is something that has been disheartening to watch and very frequent on my mind. 
      I hate seeing someone I know and love go through this and 
      hate that I am one to lose patience with them when they forget who I am and 
      other family members or have a normal conversation then 
      ten minutes later not even remember what we could have talked about. 
      It's like someone is missing but they still are standing right in front of you. 
      It is also hard when they need help to do things and 
      I am not always in the bes shape to help out like giving them showers and 
      baths because you have to have a lot of strength to do it sometimes and 
      there are many days where I am just not up to par.

      <issue>
      Lately I have been feeling down and potentially depressed 
      about not having enough money to do the things I want and 
      not being able to pay bills on time. 
      I recently had to resort to paying bills using my credit card and 
      recently have been behind on those. 
      I am able to just pay the monthly fees only. 
      Which I already knew was a bad thing to start doing. 
      Now it is the fact I rely on credit card to pay for everything because 
      my whole paycheck goes to my credit card payback but 
      still haven't caught up yet and 
      I am in the second month of doing this 
      I feel as though things are really piling up and 
      don't know what I am going to do to dig myself 
      out of the hole I feel that I am currently digging.
